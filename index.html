            Prompt the user for a number. Write a for loop that will add all of the numbers leading up to that number, and inclusive of that number together. (ex: A user enters 5, and the output would be the result of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5.)

        <p class="instruct">
            Write a do..while loop that builds a string with multiple inputs from a user. Start by prompting the user if they want to play. When the user answers yes, prompt the user to enter a word. After the user enters a word, prompt the user if they would like
            to play again. If no, console log their word. If yes, prompt the user for another word and add that word to the original string, then prompt if they want to play again. Continue to add words to the string every time the user answers yes and
            enters a word until the user indicates that he or she does not want to play anymore.
        </p>

            time add an exclamation point at the end of the string. Continue to add an exclamation point for every time the user agrees to wanting to print his or her name.
